### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Switch up the colors!
1. Design your application and use some colors that aren't weird or boring.
2. Use [a tool called Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) and pick 2 colors and you will get a resulting palette. You can click to download and then select "CSS" and you will get a file that looks like this:
```
/* Palette generated by Material Palette - materialpalette.com/brown/teal */

.dark-primary-color    { background: #5D4037; }
.default-primary-color { background: #795548; }
.light-primary-color   { background: #D7CCC8; }
.text-primary-color    { color: #FFFFFF; }
.accent-color          { background: #009688; }
.primary-text-color    { color: #212121; }
.secondary-text-color  { color: #757575; }
.divider-color         { border-color: #BDBDBD; }
```
3. Modify your CSS and/or HTML classes to incorporate this new color palette.

#### Challenge 2: Switch up the font!
1. Pick font(s) from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) and include them in your project. You can use them wherever you want, but uh, don't make it too ugly. 

#### Challenge 3: Sold out.
1. For items that are no longer available, place [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morecallan/css102-e6/master/images/soldOut.png) over top of the product card. **Note this is complex positioning, it is going to challenge you.**. What I mean by "over the product card" is ![Sold Out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morecallan/css102-e6/master/images/CSS102-Mockup.png)

#### Challenge 4: Display responsively on any size screen!
1. Use CSS to conditionally apply styles depending on the width of the screen! (or the size of the browser window) You can do this using a fancy thing called [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries). You can find a good example of how to do that [here](https://css-tricks.com/designing-a-product-page-layout-with-flexbox/#article-header-id-4).
